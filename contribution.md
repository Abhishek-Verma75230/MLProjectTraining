#I'm currently working on a model that would work like a human and would be able to differentiate between various objects that exist in the world , so for training the model I would need a lot of data .

If you want to contribute to this project and help me out you can do the following :


ðŸŽ‡Add a minimum of 10 images of any object that would help me train the model.

ðŸŽ‡Add any alogorithm that would help me train the model.

ðŸŽ‡A data set of the objects  in a seperate folder will be appreciated.

ðŸŽ‡Create a new folder in the repository and add your files or images.


The pull requests will be merged as quick as possible.

Hope you guys would contribute to this project and start your Open-Source Journey.
